          <div class="column leftwide"> The Benfield Brass Band is a non-profit
            volunteer organization which performs a number of concerts annually
            in the Annapolis/Baltimore area, as well as at the annual Gettysburg
            Brass Band Festival held in June each year in Gettysburg, PA. Many
            of the band members play together in other local instrumental
            groups, and the band has several family members playing. The band
            comes together in the fall and plays through midsummer. Ray Ascione,
            Conductor for the band, is a retired Navy Commander who, in his 35
            years of active naval duty, served as Leader of the U.S. Naval
            Academy Band and Assistant Leader of the Navy Band in Washington,
            DC, among other assignments. Since retiring in the Annapolis area,
            he remains active musically as a performer, educator and consultant.

          <div class="column leftwide"> The band was formed in 1998 to attend
            the first Gettysburg Brass Band Festival and we have performed there
            nearly every year since. The main purpose of the band is to provide
            the opportunity for brass players in the area to experience playing
            in a British Style brass band. Over the years the band has gradually
            grown in size and skill. The band has reached a size pretty close to
            the limit, but we continue to improve the quality of our playing.
            BBB is not a contesting band which allows us to grow our membership
            beyond the typical contesting sized British band. </div>
